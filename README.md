# Overview

This repository is for my Innovation Time Project for the 2020-2021 school year. The concept is a sort of quick reference handbook for drone pilots, much like how airline pilots have a quick reference handbook in their aircraft for different procedures and especially for emergency or not nominal circumstances.


## System requirements

At present (Oct. 31st, 2020), only macOS and Linux is supported. I have not modified the program to use the operating system's path separator, as such Windows is NOT supported at this time.

  2. Linux
Other requirements:
