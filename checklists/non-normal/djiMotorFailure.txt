This is the nightmare scenario. In case of a motor failure or loss of thrust on one motor in flight, you have very little in the way of options. The ones that you do have are only delaying the inevitable.
1. It's important to realize that the only thing keeping your quad in the sky is the propellers. If you lose thrust on one of those propellers, *you are going to crash*.
2. If you have control, try to maneuver away from any people or other squishy obstacles.
3. Once you're in a safe spot, I recommend disarming so that you don't have an out of control quadcopter. 
4. To disarm your quadcopter, hold both sticks down and to the middle in the same way that you armed the quad in the first place. NOTE: YOUR QUADCOPTER WILL FALL OUT OF THE SKY IF YOU DISARM. BE ABSOLUTELY SURE
Good luck getting your quad fixed, because you are going to incur a repair bill.
